### A. Customer Journey

-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
-- Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!
```mysql
with cte as (select plans.plan_id, plans.plan_name, plans.price, s.customer_id, s.start_date from plans 
join subscriptions as s on plans.plan_id = s.plan_id
where customer_id = 1 or customer_id = 2 or customer_id = 3 or customer_id = 4 or customer_id = 5 or customer_id = 6 or customer_id = 7 or
customer_id = 8)
select plan_id, plan_name, price, customer_id, start_date, datediff(start_date, 
lag(start_date) over (partition by customer_id order by plan_id)) as 'times it take to switch the plan' from cte
```

-- most customers upgrade their plan to basic monthly within 7 days of free trial, two customers upgrade their plans to pro monthly plan
-- within 46 days and 100 days, respectively. Meanwhile, customer 4 and customer 6 stop using the plan after using basic monthly plan 
-- for 88 days and 58 days, respectively.

### B. Data Analysis Questions

#### How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

select count(distinct customer_id) from subscriptions
```

#### What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
```mysql
select count(plan_id) as trial_count, month(start_date) as month, LAST_DAY(start_date - interval 1 month) + interval 1 day as StartOfMonth
from subscriptions where plan_id = 0 
group by month(start_date), LAST_DAY(start_date - interval 1 month) + interval 1 day order by month(start_date) asc

```mysql
select p.plan_name, count(p.plan_name) as count, year(s.start_date) as year from subscriptions as s
join plans as p on p.plan_id = s.plan_id

-- I would calculate the growth rate by each customer to see which customer brings the most profits till the end of 2021 and I would also calculate the growth rate by each plan to see which plan sees the fastest growth
